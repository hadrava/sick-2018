how to create map
=================
start in five terminals:
	roslaunch fortnight robot.launch
	roslaunch fortnight mapping.launch
	roslaunch fortnight teleop.launch
	./bag-record.sh
	./rviz.sh

joystick robot around (be slow, especially turn slowly)

when the mapping is finished, run in other terminal:
	./map-snapshot.sh
it should end automatically

then kill:
	./bag-record.sh
then kill everything els


how to create map - with remote teleop
======================================
instead of
	roslaunch fortnight teleop.launch
	./rviz.sh

start on non-robot machine:
	./remote-teleop-to-fortnight.sh
	./rviz-remote-to-fortnight.sh


how to re-create map
====================
start in three terminals:
	./bag.sh
	roslaunch fortnight mapping.launch
	./rviz.sh


and then start in other terminal:
	./bag-play.sh
it will list all bags
Rerun with argument:
	./bag-play.sh [bagname]

when the mapping is finished (and you want to save this map), run in other terminal:
	./map-snapshot.sh
it should end automatically

then kill everything
