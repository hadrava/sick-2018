robot.launch				fortnight run in real life

full.launch				included by gazebo and robot -- all other nodes needed for fortnight
kobuki_safety_controller.launch		special launch file for safety controller -- remaps input and output, so it works inside full.launch (but it is disabled)
minimal.launch				minimal launch for fortnight node itself
